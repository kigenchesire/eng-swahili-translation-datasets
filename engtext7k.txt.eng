Is that your new friend?
Jacob wasn't interested in baseball.
Adam told me that Alice had a new boyfriend.
The radio didn't inform about the accident.
Adam is worried we'll get lost.
We'll go by bus unless Joe and Emma want to take a taxi.
Where were these pictures taken?
You don't think Jacob can win, do you?
Oscar shouldn't have thrown rocks at those cats.
How old was Joe when he died?
Will you give this to us?
He's more popular than me.
Take one four times a day, after meals.
I'm going to Australia this spring.
Susie didn't want to talk to Oscar, but she had no choice.
William is asleep, but Carmen isn't.
Jacob felt disappointed.
Anna doesn't think she can do that.
Are you objective?
I can explain it to you if you let me.
I need someone to talk to.
James said he didn't know why Alice wanted to break up with him.
This is all we can give you.
Adam and Olivia said they thought John was having a really hard time doing that.
He broke the law.
This is too good a chance to lose.
Was the door closed?
I like chess.
Julia says Tommy will eat lunch with her.
Joe likes the way Alice did that.
I arrived too late to hear Harry's speech.
I did everything Charlie told me I needed to do.
I wonder why we didn't have any customers today.
Oliver said that he wanted that, so I gave it to him.
That black dog is looking at that white cat.
Harry and Laur aren't still hungry, are they?
Harry is fair, isn't he?
I don't think that Jacob knows how to tie his shoes.
"George, do you still love me?" "Of course, I do."
She's more popular than me.
I fail to understand what the problem is.
I don't remember exactly what Adam said.
I asked him for his name.
I don't think William knows what Alice would like him to do.
Jami and Monica said they'd leave at 2:30.
Healthy competition is always good.
Oscar is the only one who seems to know what to do.
Give someone else a chance.
James isn't in his room.
Did you see Adam leave?
George seemed to be nice enough.
I saw the window roll down.
Is there a river anywhere near here?
The book I bought is on the table.
My computer stopped working a few days ago.
Tommy asks me the same thing every time he sees me.
Would you just move along a bit, please?
Get out of my face.
Jack hasn't talked about it.
Harry wouldn't leave Lucy alone.
I have been living here for these ten years.
I get scared easily.
I thought that it'd be too much.
Did Adam and Monica say they needed to do that today?
Charlie could be doing anything.
Joe doesn't know where he was born.
Adam and Anna said they weren't going anywhere.
I almost never walk anywhere.
I don't like fishing, but my father does.
Can you think of any reason why Tommy wouldn't want to do that?
If Charlie goes, I'll go with him.
I was suspicious.
I never said that I wanted to go.
You can't imagine it, can you?
Silk feels soft.
I keep asking myself that same question.
They had only one child.
Tommy said he hopes to be back on Monday.
I can understand Greek, but I can't speak it.
We all need to learn to deal with this situation.
Are they free on Friday afternoon?
How did Charlie know that Julia was dead?
James passed away on Monday.
Are you allergic to any plants?
I'll be there till 2:30.
I want to spend the summer in Boston.
How can I pick out fresh fish?
You should read the kind of books that contain the kind of information that will be useful to you later in life.
Jacob likes to write poetry.
It came as a bit of a shock.
He said that he was interested.
The bridge is open to traffic.
Tommy doesn't know who Eva wants to go to the dance with.
This book will be helpful to your study.
Adam bought a leather jacket.
I love that accent.
I knew you wouldn't like the party.
Bring me his head.
Jami is being difficult.
Please let me know about it.
You may do whatever you want to do.
I love bacon!
I hope Jami comes over to my place today.
If William does that, I will, too.
This fruit is better than that one!
Charlie told me a joke.
James told his boss that he had to leave early.
Take your pills.
Harry needs much more than three hundred dollars.
He is a tennis player.
Her father works at the bank.
Harry is an extraordinary man.
You're not going in there.
The world’s very first photographs were taken in the 1830s.
He has no heart at all.
I hope to pass all my exams.
I've got no complaints.
I must apologize to Jami.
I'm seriously considering moving to Boston.
I don't think George understands that.
I know George knows he ought to do that.
Do they know about each other?
We had a lot to drink.
Your friendship is important.
Harry said that he wasn't planning to go swimming tomorrow.
Two of my books have been taken.
I hadn't intended to do that.
There's a place for everybody.
I think I should tell Oliver where I've been.
William stuck a poster on the wall.
You wouldn't like it.
Muhammad told Margaret that he'd help her do that.
Stop scaring her.
Muhammad said he thought that I might not need to do that today.
Susie left her jacket in her car.
I still think we should have invited James to go with us.
I take a walk every day.
Lucy really likes swimming, doesn't she?
Didn't I tell you James wouldn't like it?
Charlie doesn't like to be scared.
Are you wearing lipstick?
I'm sorry, but I have to go to the gym.
Jack thinks that I have to do that today.
I'd rather not sing tonight.
I think I have it figured out.
I know what you did in Australia.
He's not worthy of you.
Why didn't you tell me you weren't going to do that?
Adam says that he doesn't want to talk about it.
I used to dream about becoming a model.
She's only a couple of years older than me.
Someone threw a rock at her.
An understanding of people is the greatest weapon you can possess.
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
I don't have anything better to do.
But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face.
Charlie told Valentina how he and John met.
Valentina said she's been busy all day.
Don't scream, or you're dead.
Adam has done that only once.
We've known each other for a long time.
Joe said he hopes Alice won't allow John to do that.
No one in my family can do that.
It was obvious that Jack had told a lie.
It won't be easy to find a job now.
Adam and Mary aren't as rich as people think they are.
Oliver didn't doubt there would be a lot of people there.
We traveled through the whole land.
She showed me around.
I was offered the choice of tea or coffee.
We're still working that out.
The secret is killing you.
I'll be deeply affected by his death.
I need Harry's help on this.
Tommy and Valentina say they're tired of watching TV.
They're heading this way.
George said that he didn't have a plan.
Jami has a picture of his family on his desk.
You're not going to let Charlie do that, are you?
I don't have to explain myself.
No one except Jacob knows what really happened.
You get used to anything.
I don't think that anyone really understands me.
I'm beginning to understand.
You heard a noise behind you.
You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?
Oliver doesn't think Mary is saying what she really thinks.
Let's see how it plays out.
Why were you crying?
I thought the best thing would be to tell Jack myself.
I know it's inevitable.
I think Joe is pretty good at doing that.
George could have done that if he'd wanted to.
We had our reasons.
I have to help Jacob take out the garage.
James is going to be very thirsty after doing that.
George said that he doesn't think that Carmen really likes doing that very much.
She usually sleeps for eight hours.
Oscar and Carmen say they hope John knows how to do that.
You need to call James immediately.
They can leave if they want to.
Adam is just not very good at dancing.
Don't you want to know what happened to Joe?
It's summer already.
How did you ever find us?
It isn't fake.
Muhammad said that Alice knew that he might have to do that three more times.
William didn't pay me as much as he promised that he would.
I believed her.
William's windows were closed.
They can't see me.
He knows what he has to do.
Please enjoy yourself at the dance.
Dogs can't talk, but it's almost as if the puppy's eyes said, "No, I don't have a home."
You should come by sometime.
I found that in the back of the closet.
My dog doesn't bite.
Tommy and Valentina said they were planning on staying in Boston next summer.
Where did you think I was?
I helped Tommy clean the kitchen.
Ancient coins were found inside the mysterious tomb.
I think Adam and Lucy are impressed.
My father took me to the movies last night.
Adam did that, even though he didn't need to.
I'd like to see Tommy do that.
What do you think really happened?
I plan to be a doctor.
You can pick out any book you like.
You are a good student.
I hardly ever see this kind of thing anymore.
William and Lucy say that they hope you do that.
How many did you get?
James drinks instant coffee.
I don't think Adam is the one who wrote this report.
Please wait a minute.
Jami told me that he would like me to come over tomorrow afternoon.
I didn't know Muhammad wanted to do that by himself.
We're leaving now.
Oliver is taking a walk with Valentina and should be back before long.
At that moment, I felt in complete harmony with the world.
Tommy left his phone at home.
I knew George and Olivia were going to cry.
I don't like being around poor people.
What you're cooking smells good.
That's an odd choice of words.
He said he thought I'm charming.
Tell her I have a broken leg.
Our holiday plans are still in the air.
This book was a great bargain.
Harry said he wasn't sure that Carmen should do that.
Tommy doesn't think Lucy really could do that, does he?
Sun makes all the difference.
Who do you usually play golf with?
How do we do that?
Are those your dogs?
I still can't believe it.
That salesman looks pretty smart.
You have to turn in the reports on Monday.
Anna says she's grown tired of doing that.
I regret singing that song at Jami and Olivia's wedding.
He is not just kind, but honest too.
I got a big pay raise.
I wonder what Tommy will do.
I know you care about Adam.
I would do the same thing.
He got tired soon.
"Did you go to Boston?" "No I didn't." "How about Chicago?" "No, I didn't go to Chicago either."
William is almost thirty, isn't he?
From what you can tell, what subject would he have interest in?
You've got to try this.
When shall I come for you?
I know that I don't have enough money.
Charlie is excellent.
He has a website for his business.
Who went with you yesterday?
Jami isn't the one who told Olivia not to do that.
I went down to his level.
This is the computer I told you about.
I was employee of the year for three years.
George and Olivia said they didn't want to sit with us.
He likes games of chance.
She looks like she's sick.
Dan and Linda returned home.
I won't be able to finish doing this in a week.
This floor wax also makes a good dip.
I wonder if his tax returns will stand close examination.
She lied to me.
We elected her mayor.
What page is Harry on?
We're just about finished for the day.
I visited my friends William and Laur yesterday.
Oscar and Margaret probably did that together.
Jacob should have given Susie a birthday present.
I've become friends with James.
I was kind of surprised George said he wouldn't do that that.
Monica won't be able to do it by herself, so we need to ask someone to help her.
Jami and I text each other all the time.
There was an awkward silence.
Tell them you lied.
Do you really think it's necessary?
You know that Jacob shouldn't be doing that by himself, don't you?
You've never been to Paris?
I hope James and Valentina go home soon.
I thought you'd love it.
The old doctor gave individual attention to each patient.
I would have failed but for his help.
James noticed Julia's beautiful engagement ring.
Harry is our leader.
Aren't you free tonight?
They played on their college teams.
Oliver and Laur said that they were really glad they did that.
When is the party?
I wouldn't have told Alex if I didn't have to.
I only happened to pass here just now.
I am to have lunch with him.
She went out of her way to do such a foolish thing.
Harry was driving.
My brother in Boston is studying to become a teacher.
George and Susie haven't been here in a long time.
Her brother is a hard worker.
The man sitting on the park bench didn't seem to be awake.
Did he get here last term?
Alex looked through the bars.
I want something with which to write.
It takes a long time, and a lot of money, to fill that tank with gas.
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Charlie had enough money to buy everything he wanted.
What will the trip cost?
Do you want me to tell the police?
Jami told me he thought that Eva still ought to do that.
You will discuss it, won't you?
I thought that it would be better if we waited to do that until tomorrow.
I'm not sure what to do next.
I like English best.
Do you have any bags to check?
Harry said that he thought that Eva would enjoy the concert.
He is concerned about the result of the exam.
Did you know Alex spent over $3,000 on that?
Merry Christmas to you and your family.
She is proud of being beautiful.
Have you been in touch with Jack since he left?
Charlie was only trying to be friendly.
Father would often read detective stories in his spare time.
Harry told me Emma wouldn't be here.
Have yourself a drink.
Jami is the only one in our family who has been to Australia.
When Tommy opened his locker, all his books fell onto the floor.
I consider him a friend.
Valentina is a wonderful teacher.
This came for you this morning.
The towel wasn't at all useful.
You're taking on the company style.
Face it, Muhammad, it's over.
I didn't commit myself to attend the meeting.
Valentina pushed Alex away from her.
I didn't train properly.
Oscar will never believe that I did it on purpose.
Jacob would never complain about something like that.
Go pick him up.
I assumed you and I'd do that together.
Music is inner life, and he will never suffer loneliness who has inner life.
I think that you shouldn't gone there by yourself.
He said that he didn't feel safe.
Would you like some fruit?
While walking, we should know to look to the left and to the right.
Oliver and Lucy said they need to do that by themselves.
It's better than the movie.
So, it isn't hot at all.
What shall I write here?
Jacob can understand French a lot better than Julia can.
They will help you to get warm.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
That can have serious consequences.
I don't know what actually happened.
Let's talk to him.
Jack and Emma say they'd like to win.
Oliver likes swimming, too.
I want to make things clear. Charlie is NOT my boyfriend.
"Mom, you need to sign this." "Let me read it." "No, it's okay. You don't have to."
He can't have solved it.
I'd really rather not know.
Who's in command here?
You have a telephone at your house.
I guess not.
He sometimes loses his temper for nothing.
What a load of shit!
I thought that you were planning on going to Australia.
He said he had fun doing that.
I already know what Jami has done.
My lover is great at cooking.
It hasn't been done before.
I know that Jami won't permit you to do that.
James wants it so bad.
Julia was defending herself.
What university did you go to?
You always like to trip me up, don't you?
That number is just perfect.
They wanted me to buy them a pony.
You made good time.
I know Adam will be able to figure out a way to do that.
Let's eat out tonight!
Dan was deeply troubled by Linda's death.
You wanted to tell me about freedom?
I don't think Adam and I are getting anywhere.
I'll hug you to death.
We are busy men.
I'd have waited a little bit longer.
Anna can't always get what she wants.
You have a crush on him, don't you?
Do you miss your wife?
If there had been a problem, we'd have heard about it.
It's a Spanish book.
It was unfortunate that he lost his passport.
It's wrong to tell lies.
Jack doesn't want anything to happen to Emma.
James and Mary rarely use their phones.
When did you start studying English?
I got tired of waiting for James to do that.
Hey there, good looking!
Oliver bought a camera like yours.
William is very unlikely to stop doing that.
He'd rather come tomorrow.
Oscar doesn't know why Julia needs to borrow thirty dollars.
You're much smarter than I am.
Who is Dan talking to?
I'm afraid to try doing that.
Why don't you come in and have a cup of coffee?
Eva doesn't seem to understand why she should do that.
I asked Jami why he hadn't done that.
I wonder what George is hiding behind his back.
I've done that quite a bit.
If you knew, you'd tell me, right?
Bring her here.
Our city has no water service yet.
Harry is a pretty good tennis player.
Don't bite your nails.
Lately, I've been growing a pot belly. It must be middle age...
I have some advice for you.
Who is Adam anyway?
She came running with her eyes shining.
Hey, give me a break.
Harry will be happy to see you again.
French is not the only language that I learn.
Adam and Olivia say that they would've paid more.
How long do you need to learn German?
William didn't want to stand in line.
I didn't think we should be talking to each other.
Jami shouldn't have let you do that.
I'll give you anything you want.
I asked George where he'd been.
Why does Eva do that to herself?
It was quite disgusting.
I've missed my train.
Tommy should've never returned.
I bought these flowers for you.
He isn't sure he needs to do that.
Probably John will pass the examination.
One of us will have to drive over and see Tommy tomorrow.
Maybe you should put that trophy in the living room.
Alex and I were married for three years.
I found a nice tie for her.
I'm not trying to control you.
He said he enjoyed the view.
She is as old as the devil's grandmother.
Oliver and Monica told me that they wanted me to buy a painting for them.
William and Emma said they thought they might need to do that this week.
That's what I think, too.
Did the other car hit you hard?
I can hear somebody singing.
Me neither.
My job is to know these things.
Jack doesn't doubt his ability to do that.
The instructions are on the package.
Have you ever kissed another girl?
Can I get on this plane?
He met Alex there.
I did what the teacher said.
It didn't look like you were shocked.
How long has Alex been working in Boston?
Did something happen to him?
I needed to go for a ride.
Both Adam and Carmen love Thai food.
No one in their right mind would do this.
They say they're ready to do that.
Charlie knows what you've done.
George still hasn't fed the chickens.
I know why Adam got excited.
You don't think that I did it, do you?
Charlie set the table for dinner while Carmen cooked.
Alice still hasn't washed her car.
I insisted that we change our original plan.
The man was too fat to move by himself.
Lives are being lost.
Oscar doesn't know who Olivia's boyfriend is.
Oscar is the one who convinced Eva to teach John how to drive.
Why in the world would you want to live in Australia?
Carmen said she didn't want to talk about work.
I wonder whether Harry and Laur were able to do that.
Harry and Mary said that's not what they needed to do.
I can't face the truth.
My sister is a genius!
I know that doesn't look good.
We grew closer every day.
I'm going to win this.
Will Margaret really be doing that by herself?
William and Olivia didn't say when they were planning to leave.
How long did it take you to walk to the station?
He took a pencil in his hand.
Jacob hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the mess.
Laur would be surprised if she saw Jami doing that.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Does this bus go to the train station?
Don't you know?
God created him.
We're so weird.
I think that Jacob did something wrong.
Charlie has no intention of going to Alice's wedding.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
I ask myself what he did.
You'll have a very beautiful view of Boston from here.
I wish I could figure out how to control my appetite.
I told them what I like.
You really do play tap dance quite well.
It'll only take a second.
I'm pigeon-toed.
The tub is running over.
Muhammad said he hoped he'd be able to win.
Oscar would kill me if I told anyone.
Oliver failed in English.
William doesn't want Anna to go.
I haven't told anybody else yet.
We're working on this issue.
The police think she did it.
Revenge is a dish best served cold.
You're embarrassing me.
It seems pretty easy.
He left.
Tommy said that he wasn't happy here in Australia.
How long was the meeting?
Fish, please.
Tommy wouldn't talk about it.
How do you put up with them?
Mary didn't want to give Muhammad her phone number.
Where can I mail these letters?
It isn't as bad as all that.
Tommy is still in jail in Boston.
This painting will pass for genuine.
We really hope that that happens.
The window was broken by Muhammad.
James told me he was not at all interested in going to the museum with us.
They were born one month apart in 1970.
I don't care what Jack and Susie try to do.
Oscar is always very nice, isn't he?
We're not lost.
What it's like in Boston?
I can't tell him apart from his brother.
Alex said Monica knew that he might have to do that several more times.
George and Catherine say that they won't buy that for you.
I'm off.
There's been too much talk about that marriage.
I'll ask him tomorrow.
Lucy hardly ever does that by herself.
We're still trying to find out where Jacob lives.
Alice said she didn't know where she should park her car.
The father went fishing.
How badly was James beaten?
She was standing alone in the parking lot.
Grant refused to give them a firm promise.
Are you sure of this?
I tied my dog to a tree in the garden.
She said she would appeal.
Oscar said he thinks that Laur can't win.
George said he'd been betrayed.
The airport remains open.
I thought that I was dying.
Jack wouldn't let Mary win.
Charlie has to let me go.
I don't think that Alex is the one who did that.
I didn't think Oliver would want your old bicycle.
The highest wisdom is that of the heart.
Joe and Alice are getting ready to go on their honeymoon.
Jacob, I'd like you to meet someone.
There is no limit to the universe.
I wasn't the only one who stayed up all night.
I'd better go, too.
I can't understand why John turned down a job as good as that.
Jami said Susie knew he might not need to do that by himself.
Can I have a one-day ticket?
Should I tell Charlie that we won't do that again?
Jacob promised to fix Laur's broken table.
The neighborhood was silent.
Where did you buy all these?
Jack isn't lucky in love.
Times were hard.
William can't work tomorrow.
I don't think Charlie and Catherine are strict.
Adam made fun of everyone there.
Nobody can do that as well as George can.
This desk is different from the one I ordered.
Oscar will probably be desperate.
William and his teenage son moved to Australia.
Jami gave Laur a sandwich.
Adam has never done that by himself.
I am never free from worries about my child.
The movie was actually much better than I expected.
He is abroad.
Education is important.
Both Alex and Alice like to play golf.
Adam said that Valentina's dog bit his hand.
The problem was time.
Isn't he gorgeous? - So tall and smart-looking.
We owe you an apology.
Oliver was very reliable.
Adam bought a hat. It's black. Adam likes it.
What does this even mean?
Mary is pretty old, isn't she?
Aren't you going to meet Oliver tonight?
We'll just be a few minutes.
Jami looked around the forest.
I know that I should stay a little bit longer.
What a feast we had when we visited my aunt!
There's a good chance that our prices will be going up next month.
There's a red rose in the pot.
William and Olivia wanted to help, but John told them he didn't need their help.
Oscar didn't like Anna at that time.
Oliver and Eva went through the haunted house together.
The light hit Charlie's eyes.
You're a really cool guy.
The prize is wrong.
It looks like the question was too easy for you. Next time, I'll have to make it a bit harder.
She will be back in less than ten minutes.
Nobody talks about us.
George has definitely gotten better at doing that.
I'd never try to do that alone.
Is there a museum in this town?
I know Oliver is a pretty good singer.
I have to give Adam this book.
Our teacher advanced the date of the exam.
I had hardly started to eat when I noticed that she was crying.
Alex wants a new coat.
You're lucky nobody saw you do that.
Where did she hit you?
Oscar helped his son get dressed.
Charlie said that Alice thought that she might not need to do that again.
I thought that my head was going to explode.
It's a great day.
She asked him questions that he couldn't answer.
Why don't you ask Oscar if he really wants to do that?
I'm not as drunk now as the last time you saw me.
Don't take yourself so seriously.
I don't think that you believe that.
We know that you didn't kill Jacob.
Why is Tommy being so mean to us?
Charlie said he's not doing it.
Oliver was hoping we'd do that.
I think Jacob is relieved.
Oliver bent down and looked under the bed.
Joe told me that he liked this kind of music.
Generally speaking, Japanese women are modest.
It would've been better if William had stayed in Boston.
They got married and had many children.
Adam and Catherine told everyone that they were ready.
I'm going to do my homework right after dinner.
What one is is more important than what one has.
Today's not even very hot.
I shouldn't have gone to see Oliver.
He walked about the streets.
Will you give me a free hand in the matter?
He would prefer to live in a developing country because of the exchange rate.
They went on a voyage.
Anna says she likes spending time with Jami.
I still have some money in hand.
She says she will call you later.
I don't have a ticket yet.
He did it as he had been told.
Catherine told me she was upset.
Her father is a bank employee.
Harry asked Mary to lock the door.
I know you aren't scared.
Why aren't you doing what you're supposed to be doing?
We never wanted to leave Australia.
Give me a buzz if you feel like going out tonight.
I am not used to the job yet.
She's very afraid of dogs.
When do you think he'll stop?
Harry still has to do that.
There are many doubts to a child.
I'll wait here till he comes back.
They didn't have roses.
When was he here before?
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.
Alex said that he wasn't ready to go.
He took offense at what I said and turned on his heels.
He is the man who I believe can help you.
The year of the dragon has ended.
Alex wondered why Emma's face was red.
Jami isn't the only person who couldn't do that.
Can I borrow your pen?
We have a lot of homework.
What'll we call it?
How do we prevent this from happening again?
I have to choose.
Oliver has been in Australia visiting his parents.
Are you going to get this done anytime soon?
The fact is that I can't swim.
Jack was driving down the street singing along at the top of his lungs to his favourite song on the car radio.
The boys laughed loudly.
I drank the coffee.
Laur is in Boston right now, isn't she?
In summer, eggs soon go bad.
I had a lot of things to do yesterday.
It's no good making the same old products year after year.
I am studying very hard.
To have joy, one must share it.
Take one of me.
Boys think a lot about girls.
No one else will make you a better offer.
You can go out and play as long as you stay in the yard.
The promise I made to you last week still holds true.
That is not what they are going to talk about.
I wish I had written it myself.
We're sorry that we've kept you waiting.
Charlie is kind of busy now.
Harry said that Laur was glad she didn't do that.
Doing that isn't a bad idea.
I wish I could get Jack to do that with me.
William has a house with a pool.
We're aware of the risks.
The girl tore the cloth.
They don't want to live on their own.
It's likely to rain tomorrow.
Close your eyes for a moment and look for the answer.
Please come in and make yourselves at home.
I'm up to date.
Do you think George would have helped us?
He was holding a large box in his arms.
Jack has never seen Alice smile.
Some rich guy from Boston just bought the house next to mine.
He left his team as he could not get along with the manager.
He is no relation to me.
George was listening.
I want to see what's in the drawer.
I'll see you soon.
Jami wears glasses.
He's old enough to go to school.
Charlie said he isn't busy.
Did you fit all the clothes in the bag?
Let's break up the party.
They think they shouldn't do that.
I know that that's not true.
Don't argue with a woman when she's tired.
What's your decision?
I know that Tommy isn't a very good chess player, but I think he's better than Emma.
Lucy said she wasn't aware that Tommy had done that.
Adam died there.
Jack was lying about that.
I'm convinced Mary can take care of herself.
I know that Harry and Margaret are alone.
It is something my mother made.
Valentina would've done that herself if she'd had more the time.
Two can play at that game.
I'm tired of Jami's constant complaining.
Adam seems to like Australia.
Remember to post the letter on your way to school.
Jami has come back from Boston for Christmas.
Jack and Catherine look like they don't want to be here.
Which plan do you believe is better?
It's just like walking on the moon.
I imagined him a tall man.
Harry ran as fast as he was able to.
She threw off her shoes and socks in anger.
Dan came up with a new idea.
Do you enjoy talking?
My husband's situation is different.
Maybe George doesn't know he isn't likely to be fired.
Harry and Susie are waiting for us.
We're not doing anything.
I may be old, but I'm not crazy.
Oliver assured us that he'll have that done before Monday.
He asked me if I knew his father.
Lucy was wearing her favorite dress yesterday.
When does that start?
I started learning Chinese last week.
I want to get back to Australia as soon as possible.
Do you really think it would be expensive to do that?
I'm the only one who knows your secret.
Are you sure you're OK?
Charlie was upset because Susie refused to help him.
I invited her to dinner.
Lunch is served.
Could you do that tomorrow?
I'm not trying to impress you.
Tommy had to stay in Australia for another week.
I know that William and Eva know.
Are you still playing tennis?
I can see Charlie.
We're too smart to do something that stupid.
We're just waiting for it to get dark.
She visits me from time to time.
I'll arrange that.
She asked if I need a taxi.
You're still a dentist, aren't you?
Why do so many people not like Jami?
You look a bit like Muhammad.
He's a lot better at it than I am.
Are you almost done here?
Eva makes her own bed every morning.
Muhammad really does do that sometimes.
Catherine asked us to trust her.
Just follow my lead.
See you tomorrow night.
"How are you feeling this morning?" "Pretty good, thanks."
I was in China last year.
Jacob is much better now, isn't he?
Jami couldn't stop.
I gave Oscar many chances to do that.
William and Laur told me that they thought John could do that.
Oliver didn't believe Julia for a second.
It's a pity you don't know how to do that.
Oscar said that Carmen knew that she might have to do that by herself.
I contacted my mothers.
Joe was surprised that Anna had changed so much.
Every time I call on you, you're out.
This is Oliver's only chance.
It really is a good price.
The floor is cold.
Did you ever figure out how to do that?
A small gain is better than a great loss.
I know Jami didn't ask me to do that, but I did it anyway.
The British forces were ordered to seize the weapons.
I'd like to see what happens.
Charlie was the one who kissed Julia, not John.
I'm open to new ideas.
Anna is going to stay, isn't she?
Did George say how he did that?
Lucy said she thought doing that would be a bad idea.
I think you shouldn't gone there with James.
I'm pleased to have you here.
I did my job.
We still can't afford to do that.
Alex and Emma said they didn't need any more money.
You won't be able to convince Jami.
Muhammad and Monica are both telling the truth.
Adam trained very hard.
I intend to be first in line.
She is looking for her missing wallet.
All of my children go to school in Boston.
Adam said Alice should never have done that.
She forgot to wash her hands.
You're the only person I know who can't speak French.
It would've been better if you had gone to Boston with Joe.
Go ahead, give America all your hard earned money.
I thought you said that you worked all morning.
Does Jacob have a key to your apartment?
My parents love you.
They said they'd stopped doing that.
Do something about that noise.
That's all George needed.
That box is heavy.
I think Charlie and Eva are suspicious.
He made up the history.
Monica told me she's through doing that.
When Tommy came to in the hospital and saw that nurse, he thought he was already in heaven.
She's a bus driver.
Jacob didn't like living in the city.
I was done with school at noon.
I hope Oscar isn't early.
Is there any chance that Harry is doing that now?
I'm pretty sure Joe's rich.
The police broke up the fight.
Jami said he thought I seemed confused.
Linda will prepare coffee.
Emma isn't really sure what she should do.
How do we know that you're not just making this up?
Alex passed the test by cheating.
It isn't about money.
This is your wake-up call.
Susie had no choice but to do what Alex told her to do.
The problems of our age require new thinking.
I don't think that you're going to need me to help you anymore.
I thought she was out of her mind.
Laur promised Tommy she'd come to his party.
Carmen can't have done it by herself.
Oscar cries easily.
Sharks eat fish.
I suspect that James is disappointed.
You're lucky we let you sit here.
If you know a lot, you can become anyone.
I used to have a job in Australia.
I want to make sure there is enough.
You'll have to ask him.
We played on the beach.
I know Jacob better than I know Emma.
I think Jacob is uncomfortable.
I've wanted to be a painter for a long time.
Tommy doesn't know how long he'll have to wait for Anna.
I have an important mission for all of you.
This rule does not apply to the case.
Maybe Susie killed herself.
Does Harry know you love Carmen?
Don't you feel happy and relaxed?
You're acting like a child.
Ever since she fell in the kitchen, her mind hasn't been all there.
This kind of hot weather is something I'm not used to.
A good husband makes a good wife.
She said she didn't mind waiting.
The restaurant was quiet.
I am laughing at George.
I can't come right now.
James and Olivia said doing that was easier than they thought it would be.
His son is learning to drive.
Is there any chance that he will come?
The girl listened to music, the boy was reading a book.
All aboard!
Do you want to come back to my office?
I thought William was embarrassed.
I'm not telling you my phone number.
Harry was allowed to stay.
I don't like this teacher.
She means more than my life to me.
Tommy does that really well.
Joe is still not sure what to do.
They were going to kill you.
I still do that whenever I can.
What else can you expect?
I think I can speak French as well as Alex can.
Let's leave the problem until tomorrow.
Muhammad and Alice told me they had to split.
I know little or nothing about it.
Tommy and Carmen asked John to meet them at Alice's house at 2:30.
Oscar does nothing but watch TV all day.
She stopped taking her medicine.
William and Mary are going to go there the same way they always do.
I didn't know Charlie wouldn't eat that.
Jami can help.
Charlie is not proud of his past.
All I do is work.
I have a bicycle.
I bought Jami some drinks.
I fear that is the truth.
I will side with you just this once.
I didn't tell Jami I was hungry.
Monica insisted she wouldn't do that.
I'd do anything for you.
I can't believe William and Susie have both gone.
I had trouble getting Jacob to do that.
Maybe Muhammad could sing at your wedding.
Jacob reached over and turned off the radio.
Adam is sensitive.
Don't speak ill of others while they are away.
That's why we moved to Australia.
I missed you so much.
Eva wishes she could fly.
William understood me.
We help each other.
Where do you get a haircut?
I barely escaped being hit by the truck.
I assume that was the only way to get the job done in time.
Oscar told me that he thought Laur was cute.
I'm not the only one who thinks Jami should be fired.
Ken kissed Muhammad's girlfriend.
Everybody except Jami seems to be having fun.
He's in the money.
I haven't seen the results yet.
When the cat's away, the mice do play.
In many parts of the world, there is not enough food to meet everyone's needs.
I wonder whether Adam is really strong enough to do that.
I don't want to work as a waiter.
Fashion is a vicious cycle.
Oliver might be able to help me.
We need some more time.
I am ashamed to say that the job is not finished.
I have a good many things to do today.
George said that you'd be able to help me.
May I call later?
My van doesn't have a back seat.
I know I could've done that, but I didn't.
I'll jump in.
Can we wait for them here?
I knew Charlie didn't want to do that, but I wanted him to do it anyway.
Are you really afraid to be in the same room with Adam?
I didn't have time to do everything had to be done.
Charlie probably doesn't know that Valentina hates him.
Tommy turned over a new leaf when he met Margaret.
Emma is anxious about her future.
Is this valuable?
Tell him either to call on me or to ring me up.
I'm not a little boy anymore.
Adam and Catherine are probably not as rich as they claim to be.
I wonder where your brother has gone to.
Oliver listened to the sound of the ocean.
Monica says she feels much better today than yesterday.
Dan and Linda stopped talking to each other.
Did you see him at the station this morning?
Is this cup Alex's?
I had a headache, so I couldn't do that.
You cannot use his.
Why did George do that himself?
We won the match.
He hid behind the tree.
Alex walked across the room.
Valentina doesn't know I like her.
We did our best only to fail.
We stopped over in Boston for three nights on the way to Chicago.
Adam and I want to talk to you.
Alex told me he thought that Eva was wise.
He gave an account of how he had escaped.
Maybe we should call her.
Margaret doesn't know what she did was wrong.
You'll do that tomorrow, won't you?
Why are you being so friendly to Jack?
She knew me.
Her pillow was wet with tears.
Jack spent most of his life in Boston.
The wife stood up from her chair. She then looked at the door.
Is anybody afraid?
Why do you think Tommy has to do that?
I got really sick of it.
Charlie wished he could understand French.
Muhammad is likely to forget his promise.
Tommy isn't used to being ignored.
I thought that William was Alice's boyfriend.
I'll make some peanut butter.
Charlie didn't know Carmen was at the club.
There's nothing under the chair.
Is the beam solid or hollow?
She's hiding the truth from us.
The sky had become threatening before I got to the station.
Tommy left Boston in October of 2013.
It is a hall rather than a room.
In a crowded train, I make it a rule to give my seat to old people.
You need to listen to us.
Oscar said that he isn't hungry.
We'll fix that.
Is Harry in your class?
You're not anything like them.
We chose her a nice birthday present.
Charlie has three months of rehab ahead of him.
You can't be at two places at once.
She was about to call him up when he walked in the door.
Muhammad told me that he thought that Mary was still interested in doing that.
He talked to me every day.
Tommy and Laur didn't want to stop doing what they were doing.
Just slow down.
What is your natural hair colour?
Charlie came to the party with his new girlfriend.
He was in a traffic accident.
I'm going to be busy until 2:30.
I wonder if Charlie knows what Valentina did.
I promise that I won't be late.
Alex and Susie need to get used to doing that.
Perhaps the only one here who needs to do that is Adam.
I'm not interested at all.
Oliver got very upset.
He keeps a diary in English.
They all turned to look at them.
Everybody assumed that Jami and Valentina were guilty.
About a dozen trees had soon been planted.
If something were wrong with my car, I'd go by bus.
I was surprised when Margaret said she was unhappy here.
I wonder why Jack wants to go to Boston.
Everyone was doing it.
They didn't invite me to their party.
How about we meet up after school?
I told Oscar we should've contacted you before coming.
That's something you shouldn't try doing.
You wouldn't do that again, would you?
This item is rotten.
I'm not disappointed.
Don't kid yourself. You couldn't afford to buy a house like this.
I don't think that children should drink beer.
The dog sat down by the man.
What do you intend to do?
Was it worth it?
Harry knew Susie was unlikely to cry.
Jami thinks that Margaret isn't here.
Charlie has a lot of clothes in his closet.
Oliver won't likely be present at this afternoon's meeting.
My temper sometimes gets the better of me.
I'm at a friend's house.
Someday you'll regret this.
Alice told me that she'd come again.
You're very shy.
Jami told Lucy why John left.
Yes, I said that murder is a sin, but I never said that sins are wrong.
We're not proud of it.
I realize that this is a difficult decision for you.
Will you not lose your mind?
What if you did do it?
I thought that I'd be able to recognize Oliver.
I was surprised that Oliver didn't have to do that.
We have full reason to believe that it is true.
I can't do this.
Oscar told me he'd like to help.
Jack and Eva said they're glad you weren't hurt.
I need this.
George visited Mary in Australia.
While we were out for a picnic, our house's lock was picked by a thief.
You want to be finished doing that by 2:30, don't you?
Muhammad thinks that Olivia will probably cry.
It might snow this evening.
They could've saved themselves.
I don't think this was such a good idea.
How long do you have to eat lunch?
My father sat reading the evening paper.
Adam said nobody else was willing to help Margaret.
Jami gave me some advice.
My friend, why are you so serious? It's like I don't know you any more.
That's all we can do for now.
Don't you ever call them?
You're not born evil; you learn how to be evil.
Have you found an answer to this question?
If I'd wanted your opinion, I'd have asked for it.
She wanted to help her friends.
The Allies continued to build up their forces in France.
I graduated from the school.
My friends invited me for dinner.
Did you really think Muhammad could speak French?
Catherine told Oscar she wasn't interested in helping him do anything.
Neither Jami nor Mary has a lot of things he has to do today.
Harry and Susie will do whatever you tell them to do.
Are you the only one who has a key to this door?
Harry is good at playing the drums.
I had no idea Charlie wasn't telling the truth.
George told me he didn't know why Eva had left.
I can't stop thinking about him.
Tommy is about done here.
Stay calm!
Let's relax a little.
There's always something to do here.
I think that Joe believes everything Julia says.
Adam and Margaret said that they need a loan.
Charlie isn't sure who he should give the document to.
Do you mind if I go home early?
You caught nothing.
Don't let them know that.
I left you a note.
I don't think that anyone suspected you weren't George.
Is your gun loaded?
I know Harry is a bully.
I knew Jack was a better student than Alice was.
You didn't look angry.
Tommy was hanged for a murder he didn't commit.
Why were you picking up guys?
I don't work on weekends.
When do you think Adam will arrive?
I'll make sure Harry and Emma do that.
I suspect that Joe is ready to leave on a moment's notice.
It isn't because I don't want you to laugh at me, rather it is because I'd like to laugh at you.
You're seriously wasting my time.
She was standing near him.
Is the water in the Black Sea actually black?
By the way, I've got to tell you something.
Charlie said that he wasn't able to do that.
I'll give you half of this sandwich if you want it.
I thought you might be interested in this.
I eat fish every week.
We kissed each other.
Tell me, tell me.
Jacob said he wanted revenge.
Where are you from in Canada?
How many cars can this garage hold?
I think that Jacob should resign.
We won't quit searching until Adam is found.
It's summer all year round when I'm with you.
I want to change the world.
I know Oliver won't do that by himself.
Today I am messing up everything.
Tommy and Catherine said it was their fault.
I've been up since 2:30 this morning.
I'm going to give him a bath.
He's trying to get rid of the ants.
Oliver should at least take a shower.
How old was Oliver when he moved to Australia?
I bring my children to the park almost every day.
Charlie said he wouldn't be able to buy everything he needed for $300.
The poison spread through his whole body.
Life has been hard on Joe.
I may have hurt his feelings.
I don't understand why you don't want to do that.
Emma told me she liked the movie.
Tell me exactly what you heard.
Alex needed some help.
Oliver said he often thinks about leaving.
I normally don't do things like this.
O brave new world that has such people in't!
We've got a major problem on our hands.
I'm afraid I have no experience.
I don't do that anywhere but here.
James looks a little distracted.
Did you touch Adam?
He's my Mr. Right.
I know James had to do that yesterday.
I don't think it was what we did that made Joe angry.
Three months later, we were married.
Just do what I say.
Muhammad should be punished for what he did.
I hope that Charlie didn't it that too hard.
Tommy will be released from prison on Monday.
I'm quite unhappy here.
I'm sorry about that, Oliver.
I don't think that Jack did his homework by himself.
There are very few passengers in the train.
Oscar showed Margaret the photo.
What's this butterfly called?
James would do anything to get Monica's attention.
No one cares about me.
William was arrested by an off-duty police officer.
Harry does look a lot like his father.
Animals are not toys!
The track meet was called off on account of the heavy rain.
My father has given up smoking recently.
It was nice of you to ask.
I studied French for three years with a native speaker.
It looks like I'll be late again.
I was going to work when John saw me.
Take any books that you want to read.
Should I try to talk to Alex?
Charlie has been trying to do that.
I just want people to like me.
He said to me, 'Study hard, or you won't pass the test.'
We have two spare rooms upstairs, neither of which has been used for years.
Jami pulled open the drawer.
The girl tried hard to hold back her tears.
No one has seen Charlie recently.
I want to be poor in order to not be unhappy.
"Jack! Stop doing your homework. Go outside and play!" "No mom, I want to study ahead for the next test."
There's still a chance that Harry might not have to spend time in prison.
You look so good.
There, there. It's all better now.
Are you still planning on buying a new computer?
It would have been nice if you'd helped me a little.
The far left and far right are more alike than you'd think.
The timing is unfortunate.
Joe said he didn't want to sit with us.
Let me check the manual.
That forest fire happened from natural cause.
Tommy was confused by Laur's question.
George is going to make it on time.
George asked Emma for advice.
I know Charlie is almost asleep.
William still doesn't know why Anna wants to do that.
You can't ask him to do that.
Can you tell me what needs to be done?
Let her worry about it.
I'm going to be here all morning.
I don't think this is the best time to talk to Jacob.
I don't have any interest in art whatsoever.
I don't want to stand in line.
You didn't let me finish my sentence.
She told me she was relieved.
Tommy and Anna said that they didn't know.
Some people were born to make others miserable.
I can't recall the exact words.
Do you have any idea who might have stolen my bicycle?
Adam did have fun.
William is a character.
I wonder what Charlie gave Anna.
Send me photos.
You never told me you had these.
I had never been kissed like that.
Does anyone read anymore?
The moment he touched it, it blew up.
I don't think we can do that by Monday.
I kept cleaning.
Although the government refuses to admit it, its economic policy is in ruins.
Had she been alive, my mother would have given me a hand then.
Jack said he wanted us to do that.
We've all got to do better.
The police are looking into the cause of the accident.
Alex was thrilled to do that.
Did I mention Tommy and Lucy were doctors?
This boy has a strong and healthy body.
They aren't as weak as they used to be.
The studio is very small, with no place to hide.
They wanted to know where Charlie was.
George and Monica are staring at John.
Oscar says he followed the rules.
I thought that you might want to know.
Is that a secret?
Be seen by me!
Jami pulled out a pencil.
Harry said that he may possibly do that.
Tommy doesn't want to lose you.
Our country must take action against climate change.
I don't think that George has to decide right away.
Muhammad wants Laur to make sure John does his homework.
Old people need something to live for.
What's the meaning of that?
The passengers are waiting.
Jami has been a bus driver for three years.
I know Jacob doesn't know why Susie is doing that.
The weather is really bad.
Why did Bill tear the letter into pieces?
Here's some evidence.
I'm very interested in listening to what you have to say.
We can easily walk there from here.
Do you really believe it's necessary to do that?
I can't think about anything else.
They mainly live on milk.
I'm just a boy who makes mistakes.
Jami said that he didn't like to do that.
What didn't they get?
You look like you're drunk.
Charlie and Anna said they can get us what we need.
Charlie can barely speak.
He had a change of heart.
This decision was hard to make.
Both Alex and I should've left earlier.
Can you point me in the right direction?
Don't be afraid, Jack. There's no need to worry.
She was the last person I expected to meet that day.
Harry fell into the water.
You know that Jami likes beer.
Joe said that he wished that he hadn't parked his car in front of Emma's house.
Give me Harry's address.
We'll get there eventually.
We're serious.
I'm drinking.
I know William is a careful driver.
I don't want to be your secret.
We haven't talked to Oliver yet.
I still think Charlie and Susie are hiding something.
Of course I remember the news quite well.
James is coming back soon, isn't he?
Jacob hopes that Susie will do that.
They came.
Oliver is bound to know where Catherine is.
Let me tell you the reason that happened.
Mary often talks to herself when she's alone.
We have good news.
It's important that I do this.
I wasn't very good at dancing when I was a teenager.
Alex didn't hear his name being called.
He'll show up soon.
Charlie went to Australia to find a job.
The boy was anxious for a bicycle.
I know William would like Mary to do that for John.
I wonder if Harry has ever asked Mary why she didn't do that?
George said you were bright.
Do you and Alex still hate each other?
He isn't at all like his brother.
There's nothing else to talk about.
I was surprised when Alex and Valentina asked me to play tennis with them.
More research is needed.
Adam broke his right arm in the accident.
Why do American parents praise their children?
Oscar and Julia said they weren't so sure.
I heard that.
I'm not working for them.
I may have to do that today.
Tommy said he knew he might have to do that tomorrow.
Self-reference this!
Jacob is going to tell Valentina everything he knows about the situation.
What's making you so busy?
He said he was dying.
I'll come to your house.
Oscar didn't seem very surprised when I told him about that.
I'll come help you.
Joe has been waiting for this.
William will be mad at you if you keep doing that.
Our team won 3 to 1.
I thought Oscar was going to ask you to do that.
I couldn't do anything about it.
I want us to be together.
Why don't we duck back inside?
Have you told him what to do?
Where on earth are you going?
Did James and Susie say they were going to do that?
Many a man believes the story.
Why haven't you told them to leave?
Joe is trying hard.
Jami couldn't understand why they all looked alike.
He turned to a tall woman nearby.
She speaks English.
What do you think about this, doctor?
I needed you and you came.
Small hills look flat from an airplane.
I suggest that that is not true.
I think George needs a ride to the airport.
That was a really big mistake.
I wish I hadn't married him.
Mary didn't think James would let her do that.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tommy the truth.
What'll Jami do without Mary?
Oliver almost always does that.
I was asked to buy some cakes on the way home from the office.
We're trying to cut down expenses.
You said that it was urgent.
What's George's opinion?
Emma will probably tell George she won't go to Boston with him.
When I first met Muhammad, I didn't know that he was rich.
Come on, let's take a walk.
Is it really possible?
Tommy was surprised by what he saw.
Oscar said he thought Anna might need to do that today.
Alex said he thought that he might be the only one who needed to do that.
Were you surprised to see me?
This is an urgent matter.
Will you pass me the salt, please?
James is my wife's friend, not mine.
Perhaps we should call it a night.
As he grew up, he learned to put things in perspective.
If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.
Now, go have a good time. The work can wait.
We're looking out for them.
You obviously don't have time.
Oscar said that he only did that once.
I don't think William needs a bodyguard.
William and Mary say they like teaching French.
No one called my attention to it.
Jami is scared to talk to me, isn't he?
The opera starts at seven.
Are you certain it was Charlie you saw doing that?
I believe you do care.
We can't keep on fooling ourselves.
I'll get to it.
It was raining. However, they still went on their school trip.
I used to be young and ambitious, just like you.
I didn't try to respond.
That's what Alex would have done.
Adam knows a man whose daughter lives in Australia.
That's a risk you just have to take.
There aren't any books in French in the library.
Do you think your room is too small?
It's only going to take a second.
Everything isn't always simple in life.
Adam wasn't willing to do what Margaret asked him to do.
You decide on what to do.
You're really pretty too.
Jami's quick thinking saved the day.
I just had a talk with them.
Adam said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Strange to say, he didn't know the news.
William was promoted to manager.
Oh, the toast is burned black.
Alice never should've told Oscar that she loved him.
I don't play tennis , but I play table tennis.
Oscar said he hopes that Eva won't let John do that.
I wasn't surprised that I didn't have to do what you had to do.
William asked Laur if she knew when John had been in Australia.
All these things are mine.
Tommy didn't seem to be too upset.
Reading books is a habit of mine.
Jacob cut the apple in half.
I felt really bad about what I'd done.
I really enjoy swimming.
I'll go talk to them now.
Charlie and his dog are waiting outside.
I don't normally do things like this.
I decided to study French instead of English.
She said she had fully recovered.
I sometimes swim, too.
Jack and Anna said they knew they might need to do that.
The point is they're too young.
We're going to go to Australia in October.
Harry is hoping you can do that for him.
Did I touch a raw nerve?
He had to go there.
Who's knocking on the door?
It happened right about here.
James faces many new challenges.
Oscar doesn't have the money to buy a car.
I'm afraid that you're going to hurt Charlie.
Oscar and John are both blind.
I wonder whether I can do that.
James had a lot to do with that project.
I can't believe Jacob went out with Laur.
Adam didn't want to talk to you.
I think that there are more people in the countryside with a big heart than there are in the city.
Oliver asked me how to get to the post office.
Adam and I have known each other since we were kids.
Read the fine print whenever you take out a loan.
We were hoping something interesting would happen.
English isn't easy to master.
What were you doing in my apartment?
Alex may not want to do that, but he needs to.
I told Tommy to speak to you in French.
Charlie had intended to be here today, but he had to go to the hospital.
Oliver likes to do things like that.
The situation could only be settled by war.
Oliver can run faster than anyone else in his class.
Who did Oscar and Margaret say was going to go to Boston with them?
Oliver and Catherine got engaged in October.
Jami is a man after my own heart.
We made up our mind to come in any case.
You'll have to do things our way.
The trip west was hard.
William said that Carmen wasn't sure that John would do that.
James is likely doing that right now.
Adam said that he didn't think that anybody could do that.
Would you carry this up to the second floor for me?
So valuable were books that the greatest care was taken of them.
Only 514 people have been in space.
I'm glad you think so.
I had the same math teacher for two years.
How long does it take from here to the station?
He said he would write to me, but he hasn't.
I doubt if Adam will be at the beach today.
George and Emma weren't particularly kind to me.
Oliver doesn't have to go unless he wants to.
Although he is young, he is very careful.
I left home early so I'd be on time for the meeting.
I can barely bend my left arm.
Muhammad wants everyone to have a great time.
We'll settle it our own way.
I like fish more than meat.
Give William a moment.
I hate his talking big on every occasion.
What's this about, Dan?
Muhammad asked us to wait here.
Don't make that face. It will freeze that way.
William told me that he wasn't worried.
Joe said he had to help Alice do that.
Adam died a few weeks ago.
Jacob might have something to do with that.
Some bills can wait.
Focus on one thing and do it well.
Charlie and Anna promised me that they'd never do that again.
Your breakfast is ready.
You know me better than you realize.
Will you check the tires?
You like to take pictures, don't you?
Joe went back to his car to get his umbrella.
I want to be an excellent teacher.
Adam doesn't get along with his neighbors like he used to.
Thousands of kids were adopted.
Alex is just trying to help.
You've been up all night, haven't you?
Oliver definitely lied.
He is sincere in his promises.
He's been working all day and night; he must be dog tired.
Why isn't Oliver leaving?
We were happy until you came around.
You're not fond of Oliver's dog.
Did you end up going to Australia with William?
Harry helped his mother cook dinner.
I don't plan to visit Boston.
I was going to call her today.
George knew that he couldn't win.
I compromised with her on the point.
William and Olivia are trying to have a baby.
I am not in the least afraid of dogs.
I'm sure Oscar and Anna didn't know they weren't supposed to do that.
Show us the picture.
Jacob convinced Julia to change her mind.
The smell of coffee woke me up.
Oscar was still living in his parents' house.
It's not something Joe and I are proud of.
She says that she won't do that.
Did you think I was making too much noise?
Jacob said that he hasn't decided what needs to be done yet.
I didn't know Jami was a teacher.
Something horrible has happened.
I know both James and his wife.
It's not like that. We're just friends.
I wasn't aware that Oscar and Monica were sick.
She did what she planned to do.
You really should quit smoking.
Muhammad arrived at the camp safely.
Can we talk now?
I've never trusted Alex and I never will.
I had to see someone on business.
How old is this book?
Did you feel threatened?
I've done well here.
Most people like watching TV.
More and more doctors have begun to use the new medicine.
We are poor, but we are happy.
She told me that she was interested.
I speak English and you, what language do you speak?
That's how we were raised.
She could get hurt if she did that.
James could've gone camping with you if you'd let him know you were going.
You couldn't say that was a plan with any sense of reality to it.
What kind of game is this?
Harry isn't as direct as I am.
Let's save the environment!
James is still a student.
I hate it when Oscar does that.
I know that Muhammad didn't know when I wanted to do that.
She has hope.
Mary should probably tell Harry she wants to do that.
My father works in a factory.
I've finally managed to persuade Muhammad to do that.
I turned out the light and left the room.
John always breaks the ice in class.
I have the right of education.
How did you and Jacob get here?
Charlie didn't want to go back to jail.
William wasn't supposed to be here all afternoon.
Tommy couldn't believe that Laur really loved him.
I don't think anyone really thought Muhammad was busy.
How much does it cost to eat at such a place?
She got her coat and hat on.
He likes reading books.
You have no reason to be worried.
George told me that Margaret would be prepared to do that.
He's missing his right shoe.
Oliver looked like he was going to cry.
I'm not sure where I should put this.
Alex doesn't have a cellphone.
I didn't want to talk to anyone.
Life is not static.
I should do that now, but I don't have the time.
Send her my regards.
He put the book on the table.
Alex is the one who paid for the tickets.
Though he was a child, he was very brave.
You're my woman.
How can you tell who's innocent and who's guilty?
Little girls in general are fond of dolls.
Look at those black clouds.
Every girl in the class had a crush on Jack.
Why are men never happy? Because they always want the impossible.
James said he expected Emma to do that on Monday.
We are here, at the tourist office, you see?
He returned from Canada.
I gave you my heart for you to love it, not for you to use it.
That doesn't bother Jacob.
They said that they were betrayed.
They are in the teachers' room.
I can swim, but Harry can't.
I suspect Alex is hiding something from me.
Adam, Laur, John and Alice all speak French.
Describe your day.
We're going there alone.
Muhammad should be added to the list.
Charlie thought Anna probably wouldn't win.
I know Alice wants us to go swimming with her.
I didn't leave until after 2:30.
My forehead burned with fever.
Someone's going to hurt you.
Dan was last seen wearing blue jeans and a black leather jacket.
It seemed so simple.
What was the reason for that?
The only reason that Jacob came to Boston was because everybody else in his family did.
She lived next door to us.
Her mother knocked on the door.
How could such a sad thing happen in such a happy place?
Joe was convinced.
I can't leave him.
I don't understand why Jack and Olivia need to do that.
Just as the fairy tale finished, the child had already fallen asleep.
There's no reason we shouldn't invite Jami.
We have no reason to be ashamed.
At seven I'll be back.
When did you buy yourself a motorcycle?
Charlie said that Laur won't be angry.
I think you're attractive.
Just because it's in Tatoeba.org's database, doesn't mean it's a sentence.
You'd never try to do that by yourself, wouldn't you?
I wanted to do that today, but Harry begged me not to.
He isn't lonely anymore.
Harry said Anna is probably still bored.
Why does that matter so much to you?
We kept our word.
I didn't mean to yell.
Muhammad seemed perfectly calm.
Harry will make Margaret sit with the other children.
Please, don't be noisy.
What's the deal here?
He has spoken English well for many years.
Jami and Mary have both been fired because they often showed up late for work.
Did you do that yourself?
Why don't you eat pork?
Such is life.
Laur said that she wasn't mad anymore.
Muhammad didn't seem to be very relaxed.
Do you agree or disagree?
Oh! This is so cute!
He's finishing his work.
William used to be healthy.
I can't be bothered to go home!
I don't think Alex would've let me do that.
They told me they didn't get it.
Are you telling me there are more people waiting in the lobby?
I am a man of modest tastes.
They said they'd call you.
I didn't know Jack was sleeping.
Charlie was afraid that people were going to say bad things about him.
What are you scared of?
I felt like a fish out of water at this firm.
I wish to gain time.
Muhammad said he remembers being there.
I think Alex is hurt.
He said that he's furious.
Jacob felt that he could make it in Boston.
Life is hard for everybody.
They said they were retired.
I am afraid of bears.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I will have been to New York twice this time.
Jacob learned a lot tonight.
Both Tommy and Eva live on Park Street.
Joe won't be able to move the piano by himself.
It looks like you don't really know what to do.
James couldn't do it by himself.
There are two men and a woman standing next to a tree in the picture.
The audience was excited at the game.
What do you miss the most about Australia?
We won't be able to capture Oliver.
Harry doesn't want to help Catherine.
Can you make out why he won't go with us?
She took first prize in the race.
We thought it was our duty to do that.
Call me after you talk to them.
You're beautiful in every way.
She decided to do that by herself.
I need to know exactly what happened to Alex.
Alice does that when she's happy.
Margaret sleeps with her socks on.
You guys will be there, right?
Muhammad is very excited, isn't he?
Something has caught Jacob's eye.
I'm up to my neck in work.
What kind of business was Joe in?
I have visited Oscar multiple times in Australia.
I'm not really going to do that.
Don't you have a meeting?
Alex told me he couldn't do that by himself.
I thought that it was kind of cool.
I didn't know you hated Oliver.
Turn the music up!
Alex wrapped the blanket around Emma's shoulders.
Oscar's got a sore throat.
We can't do this without your help.
You'll miss the train if you don't hurry.
I'm real proud of Jacob.
I know I didn't make the right choice.
No, I really don't like it that much.
You must face your fears.
I got here Monday night.
I had never seen it.
We respect him.
Perhaps he missed the train.
William won't stop now.
Harry and I weren't the only ones doing that.
The price has gone up.
Tall trees catch much wind.
What has he tricked you into believing this time?
I am more or less the same age as you.
Can I know where you work?
At that time, I didn't yet know whether Charlie would go camping with us or not.
If I'd known Harry was in Australia, I'd have told you.
What makes you so sure of that?
I wanted to help him.
There is no limit to human progress.
I beg your pardon. I didn't think this was your seat.
Muhammad should have eaten more.
Harry didn't buy me what I wanted.
Do you want me to go to Boston with you?
We just wanted you to know we care.
Joe can't sneak up on anyone.
Oliver told me that he thought Catherine was good at cooking.
I knew we'd be late.
It's Joe's fault.
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
The chance of rain is low.
He is nothing but a child.
Put some water in your wine.
I didn't like anyone there and no one there liked me.
Do Muhammad and Emma study French?
I haven't yet done what Oscar said he wanted me to do.
I thought we were going to be able to do that.
Was that meant as a joke?
I don't think that doing that would be worth our time.
I wonder whether Jack and Anna are still alive.
Is this the first time you've tried doing this?
If that woman will love me for who I am for a lifetime, I would marry her.
Jami said he'll do that for you.
I want to start a family.
What is your favourite fast-food restaurant?
Would you like coffee?
It was time to go back.
She's more beautiful than me.
James didn't think Carmen would be worried.
I just found out my favorite hotel has gone out of business.
She says she's ready to do that.
I'm pretty sure Charlie is telling the truth.
Why did she volunteer to do this?
Monica warned me, but I didn't listen to her.
I didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
Muhammad and Margaret said they'd be back right away.
I heard a couple girls talking about Muhammad.
One day you'll understand.
I am sure he would be the last person to do it.
You had no idea when Jami and Catherine were going to do that, did you?
I remember meeting her somewhere.
Oscar and Catherine aren't going to let John do that.
James didn't succeed, but it wasn't for want of trying.
Have you ever considered becoming a lawyer?
Keep out of sight.
Jacob has been doing same job for a long time.
How many kinds are there?
I danced.
I plan to stay as long as you stay.
If he got a 10 out of 10 on the test it's because he cheated.
Jacob kept his hat on.

The worst friend and enemy is but Death.
Did you notify Muhammad?
How many days a week do you come here?
Female drivers are a constant danger.
I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.
Stay where you are until I give you a sign.
When's your rent due?
They could get hurt if they did that.
William and I started kissing.
I asked several people for directions, but none of them were able to help me.
"I dreamed of you yesterday." "Seriously? And what was I doing?"
William and Margaret said they didn't have anything they had to do.
Alex saw something different than the rest of us did.
Close the hatch.
I think that Jami wouldn't need to do that.
I know that Tommy knows that he doesn't really have to do that.
William said that Carmen was likely to still be in Boston.
You'd like it.
I can't believe we've finally finished the project.
Do not do unto others what you do not want others do unto you.
The campaign succeeded and he won the election.
I have to take care of something.
Jami has lost his phone again.
Jami seems convinced that Mary needs to do that.
You don't have to help George if you don't want to.
James set his beer down.
He said he knew how to do that.
I think his suggestion is worth considering.
This is a book I'd like to read.
She said that she'd definitely win.
I'm worried that Oscar might not be able to do what we've asked him to do.
She liked to talk about her kids.
You know that George isn't supposed to do that, don't you?
I'm going to correct this.
We live near the large library.
I know Jami is here to see Anna, not me.
I will show you some.
Monica said she doesn't think Jacob should do that outside.
I thought you guys had already left.
Where are you going this weekend?
We have to bring our teaching methods up to date.
I need you to explain something to me.
Adam promised me he wouldn't be late.
Alex and Mary punished their children.
Prices are high these days.
When did you buy that phone?
Adam became impressed.
Sometimes, I'd like to be a small bird.
Oscar felt very bad about what had happened.
That's so embarrassing.
She did it as quickly as she could.
A man with a full belly thinks no one is hungry.
Oscar went on speaking French.
William said that he thought that would never happen.
Do you know anybody around here who has a place to rent?
Adam didn't do anything else that day.
I would like to give you a piece of advice.
Oscar blamed everything on me.
Have you heard about us?
I didn't really miss Joe.
Should I bring her with me?
We saved you a seat right here.
I didn't understand what he wanted to tell me.
That isn't something I know how to do.
There's nothing for me here.
They think too much.
George makes up stories all the time.
There are a great many books in this library.
She came with her father.
I was just being polite.
This, really, isn't important.
They say that they don't remember much.
I've been waiting for that to happen.
I found out what's wrong with Jami.
Harry and I stayed at a fancy hotel when we were in Boston.
You've got yourself into this mess.
It is the mark of the kind of man I mean that he makes his own chances.
Oliver picked up some food for dinner.
